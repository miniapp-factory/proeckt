+Code the following app
+```
+Technical Specification (TS): Crypto Analytics Tool
+1. Project Overview
+
+Develop a crypto analytics tool designed to support analysts in making data-driven decisions. The tool must collect, process, visualize, and interpret blockchain and market data in real time. It should provide actionable insights on price movements, on-chain activity, market sentiment, liquidity flows, and risk levels.
+
+2. Core Objectives
+
+Provide real-time and historical cryptocurrency market data.
+
+Analyze on-chain metrics for selected blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
+
+Offer visualization dashboards for better interpretation of data.
+
+Enable alerts based on user-defined thresholds or AI-driven anomaly detection.
+
+Provide exportable reports (CSV, PDF).
+
+Ensure high performance and minimal latency.
+
+3. Key Features
+3.1 Data Collection
+
+Integrate with major market data providers (CoinGecko, Binance API, Coinbase, Kraken).
+
+On-chain data via providers such as Glassnode, CryptoQuant, Alchemy, Infura, Chainbase.
+
+Social sentiment sources (Twitter/X API, Reddit API, LunarCrush).
+
+Data refresh interval: 1s–60s (configurable).
+
+3.2 Analytics Modules
+3.2.1 Market Analytics
+
+Price tracking and volatility analysis
+
+Market depth and order book aggregation
+
+Volume and liquidity metrics
+
+Moving averages (SMA, EMA), RSI, MACD
+
+3.2.2 On-Chain Analytics
+
+Active addresses, new addresses
+
+Transaction volume, fees, mempool size
+
+Whale movements tracking
+
+Exchange inflows/outflows
+
+Supply distribution and holder age metrics
+
+3.2.3 Sentiment Analysis
+
+NLP sentiment scoring (positive/neutral/negative)
+
+Fear & Greed index calculations
+
+Social trend detection using keywords and hashtags
+
+3.2.4 Risk & Anomaly Detection
+
+Volatility spikes
+
+On-chain anomalies (unusual inflows/outflows)
+
+Exchange wallet activity alerts
+
+Sudden sentiment changes
+
+4. User Interface Requirements
+4.1 Dashboard
+
+Modular, customizable widgets
+
+Real-time charts (candles, depth charts, heat maps)
+
+Alerts panel
+
+Multi-asset comparison view
+
+4.2 Visualizations
+
+Time-series charts
+
+Pie charts, bar graphs
+
+Heatmaps of liquidity or sentiment
+
+On-chain flow diagrams
+
+4.3 User Settings
+
+Custom alert thresholds
+
+Watchlists
+
+API key management
+
+Dark/light mode
+
+5. System Architecture
+5.1 Frontend
+
+Technologies: React.js / Vue.js
+
+Real-time data handling: WebSockets
+
+Charting: TradingView Charting Library or D3.js
+
+5.2 Backend
+
+Technologies: Node.js / Python (FastAPI / Django)
+
+Data processing pipeline with caching
+
+Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
+
+Redis for real-time caching
+
+Microservices architecture is recommended
+
+5.3 Integrations
+
+External APIs for data ingestion
+
+Optional AI/ML module (Python-based)
+
+Authentication via JWT or OAuth
+
+6. Performance Requirements
+
+Real-time data latency < 1 second
+
+Backend uptime 99.9%
+
+Efficient handling of 100k requests/min
+
+Scalability to support thousands of concurrent users
+
+7. Security Requirements
+
+HTTPS and data encryption
+
+Protection against DDOS
+
+Rate limiting for API endpoints
+
+Secure storage of user API keys (encrypted vault)
+
+8. Deliverables
+
+Complete architecture diagrams
+
+Frontend + Backend source code
+
+Documentation (API docs, installation, architecture)
+
+Unit and integration tests (>80% coverage)
+
+Production-ready deployment scripts (Docker/Kubernetes)
+
+9. Timeline (Example)
+Phase	Duration	Deliverables
+Research & Planning	1–2 weeks	Requirements, architecture
+Backend Development	3–5 weeks	API modules, DB setup
+Frontend Development	3–5 weeks	UI, dashboards, charts
+AI/ML Features	2–4 weeks	Sentiment & anomaly detection
+Testing	2 weeks	QA, bug fixes
+Deployment	1 week	Production launch
+10. Success Criteria
+
+Stable real-time analytics system
+
+Accurate and verified data
+
+Intuitive UI for crypto analysts
+
+Scalable infrastructure
+
+High user satisfaction
